MiRscan3
========

Fork of MiRscan3, fixing bugs and updating the code.

MiRscan was originally developed for the detection of miRNAs in C. Elegans [Lim
et al. 2003a] and vertebrates [Lim et al. 2003b]. More recently an updated
version has been release and applied to the detection of Drosophila miRNAs
[Ruby et al. 2007].

Details on the format of all necessary files are presented in:
http://bartellab.wi.mit.edu/softwareDocs/MiRscan3/FileFormats.html

The most recent unforked version of the code, along with documentation, can be
