MiRscan3
========

Branch of MiRscan3, fixing bugs and updating the code.

MiRscan was originally developed for the detection of miRNAs in C. Elegans [Lim
et al. 2003a] and vertebrates [Lim et al. 2003b]. More recently an updated
version has been release and applied to the detection of Drosophila miRNAs
[Ruby et al. 2007].

The most recent version of the code, together with documentation, is found at:
